A real-time chatbot is an interactive web application that enables live communication between users and a bot (or between multiple users). The front end is built with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for client-side interactivity. The back end uses Node.js, often with Express.js to handle routing and Socket.io for real-time, bi-directional communication between client and server.
